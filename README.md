Remote Sensing for Archaeology Using ASTER Data
Overview
This guide provides an overview of using ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Level 1T V3 data for archaeological exploration. The focus is on identifying potential archaeological sites by analyzing different spectral bands and utilizing remote sensing and geophysical data.

ASTER Bands and Their Uses
VNIR Bands (Visible and Near-Infrared)
Band 1 (Green, 0.52 - 0.60 µm): Useful for true-color composite images.
Band 2 (Red, 0.63 - 0.69 µm): Often used for true-color composites and identifying vegetation.
Band 3N (Near-Infrared, 0.78 - 0.86 µm): Important for vegetation studies and detecting soil and plant moisture content.
SWIR Bands (Shortwave Infrared)
Band 4 (1.60 - 1.70 µm): Can identify clay minerals and surface materials.
Bands 5 to 9 (2.145 - 2.430 µm): Useful for distinguishing different types of minerals and subtle differences in soil and rock composition.
TIR Bands (Thermal Infrared)
Bands 10 to 14 (8.125 - 11.65 µm): Detect temperature differences on the ground surface, revealing subsurface features like buried structures.
Key Parameters for Archaeological Study
Spectral Analysis
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): Identifies vegetation anomalies that may indicate buried structures.
Clay Mineral Index: Detects high clay content associated with ancient human activities.
Thermal Analysis
Thermal Anomalies: Use TIR bands to detect temperature differences that may indicate buried structures.
Topographical Analysis
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs): Identify mounds, depressions, terraces, and other landscape features indicative of archaeological sites.
Hillshade and Shaded Relief Maps: Enhance topographic features for better visibility.
Pattern Recognition
Anthropogenic Patterns: Identify geometric patterns suggesting human activity, such as buildings or roads.
Vegetation Patterns: Changes in vegetation health or type indicating buried structures.
Historical Data and Cartography
Historical Maps and Records: Compare with modern remote sensing data to identify potential sites.
Ancient Trade Routes and Settlements: Use historical data to target areas for remote sensing analysis.
High-Resolution Datasets
Airborne Geophysical Data:

Magnetic Surveys: Detect variations in the Earth's magnetic field to locate buried structures or artifacts.
Gravity Surveys: Measure gravitational field variations to identify subsurface features.
Groundborne Geophysical Data:

Magnetometry: Pinpoint anomalies in the magnetic field caused by archaeological features.
Gravity Meter: Provides detailed gravity readings to identify subsurface anomalies.
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR): Offers detailed images of subsurface features and can reveal structures, walls, and burial sites.
